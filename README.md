# AppliedSynth  

A simple synthesizer built in **PureData** (Max/MSP equivalent), designed as a lightweight audio project to be shared and expanded upon.  

## Features  
- **Synth Voices**: Multiple instruments including sine, square, triangle, and custom wavetables.  
- **Sample Playback**: Includes support for `.wav` files (example: piano sample).
